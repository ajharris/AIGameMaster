Error: CodeQL Action major versions v1 and v2 have been deprecated. Please update all occurrences of the CodeQL Action in your workflow files to v3. For more information, see https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-10-code-scanning-codeql-action-v2-is-now-deprecated/
Job run UUID is 2b1b4c14-827f-491a-bb4d-b0eb56c44360.
Warning: This run of the CodeQL Action does not have permission to access Code Scanning API endpoints. As a result, it will not be opted into any experimental features. This could be because the Action is running on a pull request from a fork. If not, please ensure the Action has the 'security-events: write' permission. Details: Resource not accessible by integration
Warning: Feature flags do not specify a default CLI version. Falling back to the CLI version shipped with the Action. This is 2.20.1.
